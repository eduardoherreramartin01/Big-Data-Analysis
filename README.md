In this report, we delve into the analysis of body fat percentage through exploratory analysis, regression modeling, and ANOVA. My primary aim is to understand the influence that body measurements and age have on body fat percentage. 
After a correlation analysis with all variables in the data set provided, I noticed that body fat percentage is very strongly correlated to different body measurements, so I performed a multiple regression analysis to determine the significance of these in predicting body fat percentage. The models for both Brozek’s and Siri’s formula that used body parts circumference as predictors showed that the abdomen circumference was the most significant predictor, with hip, wrist and neck also contributing significantly. The adjusted R-squared values for Brozek and Siri models indicated that over 72% of the variability in body fat percentage could be explained by the predictors used. Cook's distance plots identified influential outliers in both models. After careful consideration, these outliers were removed to prevent skewing of the results. The adjusted models without these outliers still maintained high explanatory power, with the Brozek model's R-squared slightly improving to 0.739, and Siri’s to 0.738
To assess the impact of age on body fat percentage, I conducted an analysis of variance which revealed significant differences across different age groups. Post-hoc analysis with Tukey's HSD test confirmed that these differences were statistically significant across the three groups. The mean body fat percentage tends to increase with age, reflecting that age is an important factor in body fat percentage distribution.
The regression and ANOVA models strongly indicate that some of the body measurements are good predictors of body fat percentage, and that age groups significantly differ in their body fat percentages. These findings can have relevant implications for health and fitness professionals who rely on body fat measurements to assess health and fitness levels. Both Brozek and Siri seem to be consistent with these conclusions, suggesting that either method could be used reliably in practice.
